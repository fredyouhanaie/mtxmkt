This is an Erlang library to handle Matrix Market files. The format of
the files is described
[here](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html).

The library functions are loosely based on the
[mmio C library](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/mmio-c.html)
provided by Matrix Market.

There are matrices of varying sizes, which can be
[browsed](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/data/) or
[searched](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/searchtool.html). The
largest matrix is a square matrix of order 90449!

It is hoped that this will prove useful for anyone wishing to test
numerical analysis and/or linear algebra programs written in Erlang.
